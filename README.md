**Team Name:** MoCa

**Team members: **Vedant Gupta
              Debasish Chakraborty
              Nachiketa

**Problem Statement:** 
The task is to automatically detect what is written in the
Captcha given to you. Generally simple captchas
consist of numbers and letters in a distorted format,
but there is a twist to the PS. Instead of numbers, the
captcha will consist of letters and emojis!

You have to map the emojis in the captcha to numbers,
i.e. when you print the output, you need to print the
number corresponding to the emoji detected in the
captcha,
The mapping will be as follows:
Checkmark : 1
Cloud: 2
Croissant: 3
Heart: 4
Laugh: 5
Smile: 6
Sun: 7
